# Grants

EuroSys, with generous donations from our supporters, offers several grants to enable students, post-docs, and faculty worldwide to attend the conference. The grants cover the EuroSys conference registration, including meals, and possibly some funding toward accommodation and travel expenses.

Grants will be awarded by the grant committee based on a combination of need and merit. Students receiving a travel grant need to agree to serve as a session scribe (if required) during the conference. Applicants are encouraged to participate to the poster session and the workshops.

## Who can apply?

Funding is available to all students, post-docs, and faculty at educational institutions world-wide.

## How to apply

Applications have to be submitted at <https://ess.cs.tu-dortmund.de/eurosys2015-grants/> (a hotcrp-based submission site). The following information is requested from all applicants:

* The completed submission form, which asks for name and affiliation, participation in the EuroSys 2015 program, and the anticipated travel expenses.
* A short position paper explaining what benefits are expected from attending the conference and why the grant should be awarded. The statement should describe ongoing research and recent papers published by the applicant. It should be no longer than one page. Please write in English and upload the position paper as a PDF file.

Students are also requested to provide:

* A letter of recommendation from the advisor supporting the application. The advisor’s statement should be sent separately from the student’s application by plain text e-mail to both grant chairs (see below), and should indicate the student’s name in the "Subject" line.

## Important Notes

Receivers of a EuroSys Grant will register with a special promotion code. Therefore, applicants shall not register for the conference until they have received the notification of acceptance from the grant chairs. This is still before the early registration deadline.
