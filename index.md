# Paper submission and deadline information

**The deadline for submitting the final version of the papers is Friday, October 21st, 23:59 CEST (Zürich time). There will be no extensions.**

Submissions should be made online at <a href="https://eusys17.ethz.ch/" target="_blank">https://eusys17.ethz.ch/</a>. Submissions should be no longer than 12 pages including all content, except references. Papers must be formatted using 10pt font, single spacing (minimum 11pt spacing between lines), two columns with 0.33 inches between columns, and a text box of 7 by 9 inches. Please ensure that the pages are numbered. Authors should use [this version](http://eurosys16.doc.ic.ac.uk/calls/papers/sigplanconf-eurosys.cls) of the SIGPLAN template, which has been modified to use 10pt font, and specify the "preprint" option to achieve the required formatting. Reviewing will be double-blind, so papers must not identify the authors. In place of the authors' names, please indicate the paper ID number assigned when registering the paper, along with the total number of pages in the submission. When referring to your own previous work, you should use the third person. Papers that violate the submission guidelines will be rejected regardless of their merit. Accepted papers will be allowed 14 pages in the proceedings, plus references. Authors who have questions about their submission can contact the PC co-chairs at [eusys17@inf.ethz.ch](mailto:eusys17@inf.ethz.ch).

# Welcome

The EuroSys conference series brings together professionals from academia and industry. It has a strong focus on systems research and development: operating systems, data base systems, real-time systems and middleware for networked, distributed, parallel, or embedded computing systems. EuroSys has become a premier forum for discussing various issues of systems software research and development, including implications related to hardware and applications.

EuroSys’17 will follow the pattern established by the previous EuroSys conferences, by seeking papers on all aspects of computer systems. EuroSys’17 will also include a number of workshops to allow junior and senior members of the systems community to explore leading-edge topics and ideas before they are presented at a conference.
