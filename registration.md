Please note that our registration system (including on-site) is
designed to support payment by credit card and credit card use is
strongly preferred. Payment by wire transfer 
order is possible, but must be arranged directly with the conference
chair. Due to the delays typical in processing such transactions,
conferees using these methods should expect to have to pay for “late
registration”.
