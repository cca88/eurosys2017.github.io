# Practical informations

## Building Map

![Building map](/assets/img/enseirb-map.png){:class='logo center'}

Workshops will be held in the rooms TD 8 to 13 at level 1 and in Amphi F to H at level -1.  The registration desk is located in front of the main conference room, level 0. Lunches and breaks will be held in "*Espace Ingénieur*" at level -1, closed to the main entrance. Because of Vigipirate, the anti-terrorist security plan, outside doors may be kept closed, please keep your badge with you at all times.  

## Internet

Internet access is provided to attendees inside the conference building. Connect to the wireless network with SSID `Eurosys` using the credentials inside your badge. You might get a security warning upon the first connection as the authentication server uses self-signed credentials. You can safely ignore the warning. You can also use the `IPBNEW` network with the same credentials or the `eduroam` network.

## Working area

A working area for EuroSys attendees is located in the common room close to the registration desk (**Foyer**).

## Coffee Breaks and Lunches

All coffee breaks and lunches will be held at "*Espace Ingénieur*", closed to the main entrance (level -1). Additionally, we provide "*Coffee / Tea*" tickets, at a rate of one ticket per registered day, to be used at any time at the student bar closed to the registration desk.

## Public Transportation

A 4-day free transport pass is included in the registration bag (bus, tram, boat). Additional tickets are available for accompanying persons; please ask at the registration desk. Tickets must be validated each time you board a bus, tram or boat.

## Tourist Information

If you are interested in visiting the UNESCO cultural heritage city of Bordeaux, please consult the tourist information provided with the registration package.
