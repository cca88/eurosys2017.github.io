### By plane

![Bordeaux](/assets/img/bx5.jpg){:class='img-thumbnail pull-right right'}

With its international airport, Bordeaux is connected to the rest of the world through 4 of the biggest european hubs:

* Paris (at least 5 flights per day)
* Amsterdam (at least 2 flights per day)
* London (at least 2 flights per day)
* Lisbon (at least 1 flight per day)

To come from the Bordeaux airport to the center of Bordeaux, you can use either:

* a city bus (40 minutes, but the cheapest way)
* a shuttle bus (30 minutes)
* a taxi (20 minutes).

More information on how to go to the center of Bordeaux is available [here](http://www.bordeaux.aeroport.fr/en/info/getting-to-bordeaux-airport){:target="_blank"}


### By train

![Bordeaux](/assets/img/bx4.jpg){:class='img-thumbnail pull-left left'}

The Bordeaux train station is connected to Paris by the High Speed Train (TGV), in 3 hours (25 trains/day). The city centre is linked to the train station by direct tramway. You can also go to Bordeaux by train from many European cities (such as Brussels, London, Luxembourg, Geneva, Stuttgart , Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Madrid), but expect a long trip. More information [here](http://en.voyages-sncf.com/en/){:target="_blank"}.


### By car

Bordeaux can be easily reached by car, because it is connected to many motorways. Nevertheless, expect a long trip because Bordeaux is not close to many other large french cities. The closest large city is Toulouse (2 hours drive), and Paris is at 5h30.
