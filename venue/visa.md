# Visa

International registrants should be particularly aware and careful about visa requirements, and should plan travel well in advance.

Note that different countries and regions may have different required documents and different elapsed times to complete the procedure.
The EuroSys 2015 organizing committee can provide you a VISA letter, documenting the purpose of your trip.

Request for an official invitation letter for your visa application must be
done, once you are registered and after the conference fee is paid, by sending an email with your institutional email address to <eurosys2015-local@labri.fr> containing the
following information :

- Last Name, First Name
- Institution
- If you are an author of an accepted paper
- Title of the paper (if author of an accepted paper)
- Nationality
- Passport Number

You will receive a scanned copy of a signed visa letter few days after your registration has been completed.
If you need the original hard copy, we will post it to you by ordinary mail on request.
For additional information or specific request, please contact  <eurosys2015-local@labri.fr>
