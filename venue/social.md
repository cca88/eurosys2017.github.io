## Wine and Cheese

> Château LUCHEY-HALDE,

The wine and cheese session generously supported by Huawei will be held at "*Château Luchey-Halde*" in the appellation Pessac-Léognan.
Buses will leave right after the end of the general assembly from the ENSEIRB-Matmeca conference building.

A free shuttle service from 18:30 to 21h00 will be available from the Château to ENSEIRB-Matmeca and Bordeaux downtown.
A faster and more convenient way to go back downtown from the château is to use public transportation. The closest tramway station is "*Fontaine d’Arlac*" (Tramway Line A), and the direction is: *La Gardette*, C*arbon Blanc*, *Cenon Gare* or *Floirac Dravemont* (or any direction at the same platform). The walk between Château Luchey-Halde and the tram station is approximately 10 minutes. There should be a tramway around every 5 minutes and the trip is around 13 minutes.


## Banquet Dinner

> Palais de la Bourse,
> 17 Place de la Bourse,
> 33000 Bordeaux

The banquet dinner, generously supported by VMware, will be held in the famous "*Palais de la bourse*". The banquet starts at **19:30**. This palais is ideally situated in downtown in front of the water mirror.

The palais is walking distance from most of the downtown hotels and easily reachable by tramway from ENSEIRB-Matmeca with Line B. See the following map for the closest tramway stops. If you have to take the tramway to go back to ENSEIRB-Matmeca, note that **the last tram** departs from "*Grand Théatre*" at **00:59**.
