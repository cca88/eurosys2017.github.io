# Call for Shadow PC Participation

Nuno Preguica (U. NOVA Lisboa) and Dushyanth Narayanan (MSR Cambridge) are organizing a shadow program committee for the Eurosys 2015 conference under the sponsorship of Eurosys. If you are interested in participating, please send e-mail to <mailto:shadowpc2015_chair@eurosys.org> before September 15th 2014. Please include a short paragraph describing your current research, areas of expertise, and publications if any: this will help us with assigning papers for review. Please also get in touch if you have any queries.

## Principle

Being on a shadow PC is an excellent opportunity for young systems researchers (PhD students, post-docs and new faculty members) to get experience in community service â€” i.e. programme committee practices.

Shadow PC members are expected to write their own detailed and rigorous reviews for their assigned papers. We expect a review load of 15--20 papers per member. Members *especially those based in Europe* are also expected to attend a one-day shadow PC meeting in person: this will be in Cambridge, UK. Members will be responsible for their own travel and accommodation for the PC meeting. Eurosys has some limited funds that we will use for travel grants to help with the costs of this; please contact <mailto:shadowpc2015_chair@eurosys.org> for more details.

The Eurosys shadow PC will follow roughly the same timeline as the main PC (<http://eurosys2015.labri.fr/>).  We plan to have the shadow PC meeting close in time to the main PC meeting (week of January 19--23 2015) and in the same place (Cambridge). We are also planning a one-day workshop in Cambridge that week to which both shadow and main PC members are invited.

Being a member of a shadow PC is a lot of work without any recognition. However, it is also very rewarding and worthwhile for a number of reasons, including:

* Getting to know how a PC is run and how it operates.
* Seeing how the same papers that you review, are viewed by others.
* Getting to see both strong and weak papers at the submission stage.
* Discovering what it takes to publish a paper in a highly selective conference such as EuroSys.
* Having a chance to read top-notch papers in your area of expertise before they are published.
* Submitting high quality reviews makes one a possible candidate for future PCs.
* Discussing the papers with one or more EuroSys PC members who will attend the shadow meeting.
* Getting to know other Shadow PC members.
