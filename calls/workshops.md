# Call for Workshops

Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit proposals for workshops to be held in conjunction with the EuroSys’17 conference. The purpose of workshops is to provide a forum for exchanging opinions, presenting ideas, and discussing preliminary results in an interactive atmosphere.

Proposals should include:

* The workshop name and a 150–200-word abstract describing the workshop, suitable for the conference web site.
* A short summary of the topic, scope and significance of the workshop, including a discussion on the relevance to EuroSys topics (please include information about past iterations of the workshop, if any).
* Information about the procedure for selecting papers, plans for dissemination (for example, special issues of journals, or position statements distributed to the participants), the expected number of participants, and the planned workshop format.
* A brief CV of each of the organizers including contact addresses and an identification of a single primary contact.

The definite dates for workshop submissions and camera-ready deadlines are yet to be set. However, we expect that EuroSys paper notifications will be sent out by end of January 2017, thus the workshop submission deadlines should be after that. Workshop notifications must probably be sent out by the end of February 2017, so that authors can benefit from the early registration rate. Furthermore, camera-ready copies of the papers must be provided by probably in March 2017, in order to include them in the electronic version of the proceedings. We will provide the definite dates as soon as they become available.

All proposals will be judged on their merits and the best proposals will be accepted. Specifically, workshops that have been organized at previous iterations of Eurosys are not automatically accepted this year. For instance, we will take into account the success of previous events (in terms of attendance, submissions, etc.) in our deliberations.

## Responsibilities

The EuroSys organization provides:

* A link on the EuroSys Web site
* Management of registration for participants
* Setup of meeting space and related equipment
* Coffee-breaks and workshop lunch arrangements

For workshops interested in publishing their proceedings, the EuroSys organization will provide the following support. Note that workshop proceedings will not be included in the same volume as the EuroSys conference proceedings.

* Collect camera-ready versions of the papers and their copyright forms
* Provide support for publishing on the on-site CD
* Provide support to obtain an ISBN number
* Publish papers in ACM digital library

The main responsibility of organizing a workshop goes to the chairperson(s) of the workshop. The workshop organization must take care of:

* Coordinating deadlines and acceptance notifications for workshop papers with the EuroSys Workshop co-chairs
* Workshop publicity, call for papers, and submission and review process
* Providing a brief description of the workshop for inclusion on the EuroSys Web page
* Scheduling workshop activities in collaboration with the EuroSys local organizers
